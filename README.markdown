CWAC-Cam2: Taking Pictures. Made (Somewhat) Sensible. Again.
============================================================

Taking pictures using a third-party app is fairly straightforward,
using `ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE` and `ACTION_VIDEO_CAPTURE`. However, different camera
apps have slightly different behavior, meaning that you are prone to getting
inconsistent results.

Taking pictures using the Android SDK camera classes directly is
eminently possible, but is full of edge and corner cases, not to mention
its own set of per-device idiosyncracies. Plus, there are now two
separate APIs for this, three if you count `MediaRecorder` for
video recording.

`CWAC-Cam2` is an effort to create an in-app `ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE`/`ACTION_VIDEO_CAPTURE`
workalike, with a bit more configurability. You still integrate by
opening up a separate activity (`CameraActivity` and `VideoRecorderActivity`, in this case), but
it is all within your own app, rather than relying upon device- or
user-specific third-party camera apps.

Library Objectives
------------------
The #1 objective of this library is maximum compatibility with hardware. As such,
this library will not be suitable for all use cases.

The targeted use case is an app that might otherwise have relied upon
`ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE`/`ACTION_VIDEO_CAPTURE`, but needs greater reliability and somewhat greater
control (e.g., capture images directly to internal storage).

If you are trying to write "a camera app" &mdash; an app whose primary job is
to take pictures &mdash; this library may be unsuitable for you.

Installation
------------
To integrate the core AAR, the Gradle recipe is:

```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        url "https://s3.amazonaws.com/repo.commonsware.com"
    }
}

dependencies {
    compile 'com.commonsware.cwac:cam2:0.3.+'
}
```

The `cam2` artifact depends on some other libraries, available in
JCenter or Maven Central. They should be pulled down automatically
when you integrate in the `cam2` AAR.

You are also welcome to clone this repo and use the `cam2/` Android
library project2 in source form.

Basic Usage
-----------

The only supported API at the moment is through
[`CameraActivity` and its `IntentBuilder`](docs/CameraActivity.md) for
still pictures and
[`VideoRecorderActivity` and its `IntentBuilder`](docs/VideoRecorderActivity.md)
for videos. You will also want to review
[the documentation regarding permissions](docs/Permissions.md), as
while the library will work "out of the box", most likely you will
want to do some permission setup in your app for Android 6.0+ devices.

While there are other `public` classes and methods in the library,
ones that *may* be exposed as part of a public API in the future,
**they are not supported at the present time**.

**NOTE**: Ensure that you do not block hardware acceleration for
the library-provided activities. In other words, do not have
`android:hardwareAccelerated="false"` for your whole
`<application>` in the manifest.

Tested Devices
--------------
The [compatibility status page](docs/CompatibilityStatus.md) outlines
what devices have been tested with this library by the library author.

Dependencies
------------
The `cam2` artifact depends upon `com.github.clans:fab` (for a floating
action button and floating action menu implementation) and
`de.greenrobot:eventbus` (for internal communications within the
library). Both are listed as dependencies in the AAR artifact metadata
and should be added to your project automatically.

ProGuard
--------
It is recommended that you not obfuscate the classes in CWAC libraries:

```
-keep class com.commonsware.cwac.** { *; }
```

If you feel that obfuscating open source code makes sense,
at minimum you will need to employ
[appropriate rules](https://github.com/krschultz/android-proguard-snippets/blob/master/libraries/proguard-eventbus.pro)
to prevent greenrobot's EventBus code, and this library's
use of it, from being obfuscated.

Version
-------
This is version v0.3.2 of this library, which means it is coming
along slowly.

Demo
----
There are two demo projects.

One is `demo/`. This illustrates taking pictures using the front
and rear-facing cameras. More importantly, it serves as a way of
collecting information about a device, particularly if you are
going to [file a bug report](CONTRIBUTING.md).

The `demo-playground/` sample project displays a `PreferenceFragment`
where you can tweak various `IntentBuilder` configurations, then tap
on an action bar item to take a picture using those settings. This is
good for experimenting with the `CameraActivity` and
`VideoRecorderActivity` capabilities.
