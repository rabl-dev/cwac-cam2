# CWAC-Cam2 and Permissions

Courtesy of Android Studio's manifest merger process, this library
will automatically add some permissions to your app's manifest:

- `CAMERA`
- `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`
- `RECORD_AUDIO`

Most apps using this library will need these permissions. However,
there are other considerations you may need to take into account
for your apps with respect to permissions.

## Android 6.0 Runtime Permissions

## Blocking Permissions

If you do not intend to take videos, you could get away without
the `RECORD_AUDIO` and perhaps the `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`
permissions. To remove those from your app's manifest, add
the following elements to your manifest, as children of the
root `<manifest>` element:

```xml
<uses-permission
    android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"
    tools:node="remove"/>
<uses-permission
    android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"
    tools:node="remove"/>
```

This tells the manifest merger process that while one or more
libraries might be asking for these permissions, block them
from the app's manifest generated by the merger.
